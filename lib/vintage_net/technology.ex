  Handle an ioctl that has been requested on the network interface

  The function runs isolated in its own process and only one ioctl is guaranteed

  kill the ioctl if the user changes their mind and reconfigures the network interface.

  Ioctl support is optional. Examples of `ioctl`s include:

  * `:scan` - scan for WiFi networks
  * `:statistics` - return a map of network statistics
